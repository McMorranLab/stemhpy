[EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH]

Tools for analyzing scanning transmission electron microscopy holography (STEMH) data.

Written by Andrew Ducharme and Levi Brown. dataAnalysis.ipynb is the most recently updated analysis code, drawing functions from stemh_tools.py.

This branch attempts to use the algorithm of Offelli and Petri to eliminate numerical artifacts in the FFT of a function.
