# stemhpy

Tools for analyzing scanning transmission electron microscopy holography (STEMH) data.

Written by Andrew Ducharme and Levi Brown. dataAnalysis.ipynb is the most recently updated analysis code, drawing functions from stemh_tools.py.

See branch levi-accelerated for Levi's work to optimize computation time. It only works for data taken with the 4D Camera on the TEAM 0.5.
