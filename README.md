# adlb_tools

Andrew Ducharme and Levi Brown's tools for using interferometric scanning transmission electron microscopy (ISTEM) techniques to quickly acquire the phase of specimens measured through 4D-STEM. It uses the h5 files output by the TEAM 0.5.

i4dstem.ipynb is the fastest, most recently updated analysis code, drawing functions from stemh_tools.py. levi_tools contains Levi's work to optimize computation time.
